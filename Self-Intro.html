    <pre style="line-height: 25px; text-align:left; font-size:120%">
<br>Although my was major in <strong style="color:brown">Traffic Engineering</strong> during my undergrade, I still can't resisted the temptation of doing what I love since middle school. I eagerly hoped to start a career in Information Technology, especially in Internet realted field. So I started a website with some friends of mine and <strong style="color:blue">tought myself some coding, website managing and promoting skills</strong>. After graduated, I worked as a <strong style="color:red">product manager</strong> at one of the fastest growing mobile social app company in China, which was a dream come true. My job included <strong style="color:purple">conducting market research, finding out features that are most desired and problems that are most urged to be solved. I also design my own solutions for function requirements and product prototypes, then worked with engineers to make my solutions come to live</strong>. However, during my work, I found myself in a lack of professional education in this field, which is why I choose to apply for MSIS program at Drexel University to catch up with my shortage and boost my career in 
technology field.

    <h2 style="font-family:cursive; text-align:center">What is HTML ?</h2>
    <pre style="text-align:left;line-height:25px;font-size:120%">
<br>HTML is a mark up language which is used specifically for designing webpages, these are some thoughts of mine on HTML and CSS till now. <ins>Different opinions are welcomed</ins> :)
    </pre>
    <dl style="text-align:left; text-indent:60px; line-height:25px;font-size:110%">
      <dt>It's somehow like a natural language</dt>
        <dd>- code lines are highly readable, even to someone with zero knowledge in HTML</dd>
        <dd>- attributes, styles and elements are named based on relevant English words, it's easy to remember and use</dd><br>
        
      <dt>It's a tag based language</dt>
        <dd>- tags shows where the position of the elements are, also the types of the elements.</dd>
        <dd>- the critical part is to set up the "tag structure" of the webpage, after that, writing content is just like filling the blanks </dd><br>
      
      <dt>CSS feels like a block designing tool</dt>
        <dd>- the webpages are basically a LEGO, constructed block by block, CSS set up a design rules for each block and assign to the blocks by using id and classes  </dd>
        <dd>- HTML generate the content, CSS is in respond for the layout</dd>
